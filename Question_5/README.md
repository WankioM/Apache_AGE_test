# BitNine-Inspired Website with Login and Signup Pages


This project showcases my implementation of creating a website similar to BitNine's official website, while also incorporating a login and signup page. The goal is to demonstrate my skills in web development using React and Express.

## Features

- **BitNine-Inspired Design:** The website's design is inspired by the layout, styles, and elements of BitNine's official website (https://bitnine.net/).
- **Login Page:** Users can log in using their credentials.
- **Signup Page:** New users can sign up to create an account.

## Technologies Used

- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Express: A web application framework for Node.js used to build server-side APIs and handle requests.
- (Add other technologies you used)
